**Clone repository from ssh:gitbox**                               
*You should be assigned to the project, ask for r-w permission to your employer*

Check if you have the permission, then clone the project.
````
ssh gitbox

git clone gitbox:/.../your_project/...
````
----

**Create your personal branch from intermedio**                            
*If exist, otherwise create your branch (and intermedio) starting from master/main*

  
````
git fetch

git checkout sviluppo_intermedio

git checkout -b your_branch

````
----

**Check for updates**                                               
*NB if you have uncommitted files push on your branch or stash it*


Check if there are updates on intermedio.
````
git fetch 
````
Pull & Resolve conflicts if present.
````
git pull origin sviluppo_intermedio
````
Push the updates on your branch.
````
git push origin your_branch
  ````

----
  

**Push all files on your branch**

Check if there are some files that you do not want to push. 
````
git status
````
If it's alright proceed.
````
git add *
````
Otherwise add only the files that you want to push.
````
git add file1 file2 file3
````
Then commit and push the changes.
````
git commit -m "commit"

git push origin your_branch
````

----
  

**Push all files on intermediate branch**

````
git add *

git commit -m "commit"

git push origin your_branch
````
Check if there are some updates, in this case pull, then push and merge update on your branch resolving eventually conflicts.
````
git fetch

git pull origin intermediate_branch

git push origin your_branch
````
Then checkout to the intermediate branch, pull the merged updates of your branch (should be conflict-free at this point) then push on intermedio and ***back to your branch.***
````
git checkout intermediate_branch 

git pull origin your_branch 

git push origin intermediate_branch 

git checkout your_branch
 ````

----

  

**Put current development on stash**  
*Useful when you want to get new updates without push on your branch, maybe for WIP/test code*
<br>
````
git stash
````
 
**Retrive file from stash**

  ````
  git stash apply
````
